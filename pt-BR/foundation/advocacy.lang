;How we work: A focus on depth and scale
Como trabalhamos: Um foco em profundidade e escala


;Mozilla’s advocacy approach incorporates both scale to depth and depth to scale to properly address the diversity of issues that we work on.
A abordagem da advocacia da Mozilla é tanto de escala a profundidade quanto de profundidade a escala para tratar corretamente a diversidade de problemas em que trabalhamos.


;This approach enables Mozilla to simultaneously build our capacity to mobilize millions of people quickly and grow our organizing power in local communities, which will make it possible to win on our issues in the long-term.
Esta abordagem permite que a Mozilla simultaneamente construa nossa capacidade de mobilizar milhões de pessoas rapidamente e faça crescer nosso poder de organização em comunidades locais, que tornarão possível vencer nossas batalhas a longo prazo.


;We also push ourselves to be proactive — setting the topic and tone of the conversation, and promoting solutions — as well as reactive to current events or undesirable policies when necessary.
